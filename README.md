# Global Air Quality Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of global air quality data. It encompasses several key aspects, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), forecasting future air quality levels, detecting anomalies, and performing regression analysis. The goal is to provide a deep understanding of air quality patterns and predict future trends, thereby supporting better environmental management and public health decisions.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Transform raw air quality data into a structured format, ensuring all numerical values are compatible with modern libraries.
  - **Visualizations**: Create histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand distributions, relationships, and correlations between various pollutants and weather conditions.
  - **Statistical Summary**: Generate descriptive statistics and assess data quality to uncover key trends and patterns in the dataset.

- **Forecasting**:
  - **Model Implementation**: Use the Prophet forecasting model to predict future air quality levels, incorporating historical data to account for seasonal trends and other influencing factors.
  - **Visualization of Forecasts**: Display both historical and forecasted air quality levels, including confidence intervals to assess forecast accuracy.

- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - **Identification of Outliers**: Detect unusual spikes or drops in pollutant levels using statistical methods and visualization techniques.
  - **Impact Analysis**: Analyze the potential causes and implications of detected anomalies on public health and environmental policies.

- **Regression Analysis**:
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Build regression models to understand the relationship between air quality pollutants and influencing factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of regression models and their ability to explain variations in air quality.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze global air quality data through EDA, forecast future air quality levels, detect anomalies, and perform regression analysis to understand the relationships between pollutants and environmental factors. By combining these approaches, the project aims to provide actionable insights into air quality trends and support data-driven decision-making.

## Insights
- **Air Quality Trends**: Discover trends and patterns in air quality across various cities, highlighting key pollutants and their variations over time.
- **Future Predictions**: Use forecasting results to anticipate future air quality levels and prepare for potential high pollution events.
- **Anomaly Impact**: Identify and analyze anomalies to understand their impact on overall air quality and potential health risks.
- **Regression Findings**: Gain insights into how environmental factors influence pollutant levels, aiding in the development of targeted strategies for improving air quality.
